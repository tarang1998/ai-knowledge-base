# Generative AI 

- Generative AI generates new data (image, text, audio, video) as output, based on the training sample.
- Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning is a subset of Machine learning and generative AI is the subset of Deep Learning.

## Large Language Models 
- LLM's are machine learning models that use deep learning algorithms to process and understand natural language.
- They are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language.
- A single LLM model can be used to perform a whole variety of tasks like text to text generation, text to image generation, image to text generation, language translation, chatbot, summarizer and code generation. This makes LLMs quite powerful.
- Eg: Gemini, GPT, XLM, T5, Llama

## Generative AI Pipeline
- A set of steps followed to build an end to end GenAI software
    - Data acquisition
    - Data preparation
    - Feature engineering
    - Modeling
    - Evaluation
    - Deployment
    - Monitoring and model updating

## Types of recommender systems 

- Demographic filtering

Demographic filtering is a recommendation system that uses a user's demographic information to suggest items or content that may be relevant to them. It's based on the idea that users with similar demographics have similar preferences.

- Collaborative filtering based

The collaborative filtering method is based on gathering and analyzing data on user’s behavior. This includes the user’s online activities and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users.

- Content based

Content-based filtering methods are based on the description of a product and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In this recommendation system, products are described using keywords, and a user profile is built to express the kind of item this user likes.

- Hybrid based 

In hybrid recommendation systems, products are recommended using both content-based and collaborative filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products to customers. This recommendation system is up-and-coming and is said to provide more accurate recommendations than other recommender systems.
